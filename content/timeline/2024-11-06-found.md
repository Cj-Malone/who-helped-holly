Holly was found dead in her old flat, by agents of the landlord.
To this day it's still not clear who specifically found her.
Some say BC who had been send by Sound Service to clear it, some say the structrual engeneer, some say there was a manager of the letting agency.
Nor is it clear how many police turned up on site.

Police used the neighbours crowbar to enter the bathroom.

Hollys phone, bag and purse we're not recovered from the scene.
