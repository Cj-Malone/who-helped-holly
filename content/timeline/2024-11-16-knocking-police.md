CM and BT visited the police station to find out what was going on.

We told him who was the last person to see Holly, and when.

We told him where her car was, he was supprised to hear she had a car.

He refused to investigate the missing phone, bag and purse.
We were very worried as these key items being missing impyed Holly wasn't alone at the time, or around the time.
He told us we would have to talk to the banks to get the last transaction date, obviously the banks wouldn't tell us anything.

He tried to tell us that Hollys front door was broken from the inside...
However we had first hand knowledge it was broken from the outsite.
