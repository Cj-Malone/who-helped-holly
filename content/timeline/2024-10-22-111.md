CM calls 111 because Holly hasn't eaten in about a week.
111 asks to talk to Holly, CM says she's drunk and pretending to be asleep.
Holly eventually talks to 111, 111 ask if "She wants help", Holly says "no" and 111 hang up.

CM was angery with Holly, but Holly says "they never helped any of the times I asked for help".
