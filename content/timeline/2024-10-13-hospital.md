Holly and CM go to St Mary's Hospital via a taxi via a 111 referral for numb feet due to prolonged drinking.
Holly was given a blood test in which the doctor says Holly does not have diabetes.
When CM asked for a detox he said "St Mary's doesn't do detoxes anymore" (we later find out this was a lie).

Holly is discharged and given 2 pairs of socks.
