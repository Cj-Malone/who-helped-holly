BT and CM returned to the police station to give formal statments.
This time the Canadian police officer was accompanied by another officer.

The Canadian took BTs statment, the other barely said anything but was writing BTs statment from CMs point of view.
It was full of inaccuracies.

The statments given to us to review, but before CM could fix his the Canadian said "We only had 60 seconds, because the room needed to be used for something else".
The other officer then took the laptop, did some typing and gave it back to CM for 2 signatures.
CM asked what they were for, but he wasn't told.
CM also was not allowed to rereview the statment, there or later.
