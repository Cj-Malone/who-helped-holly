Holly phones 101 to inform them about CMs upstairs neighbour who assaulted her a few days before.
Holly explicitly says she doesn't want any kind of prosecution/punishment for Mark, just for someone to talk to him.
101 is very supportive, however when a local officer calls back to talk to Holly he belittles her.

Telling her she was in the wrong building, CM took the phone and points out she was in the right building.
Asking for evidence (He is informed there is a camera opposite the front door that will have caught it, another neighbour also witnessed part of it) because otherwise the CPS wont do anything.
He is again reminded Holly doesn't want the CPS involved, just for someone to knock on his door and talk to him.

To this day, nobody has.
