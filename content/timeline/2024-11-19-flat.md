Sound Service finally allow CM and BT into Hollys old flat.
The phone, bag and purse are all easily visible.

Despite the Canadian police officer saying it was clear she had been living there along time, it was actually clear she died pretty soon after arriving.
There were only 3 empty cans of beer, the 4th was presumably in the car.
There was also several empty cans of coke (Little red ambulances), which she would have switched to after she ran out of beer.
There was still one unopened can of coke.
